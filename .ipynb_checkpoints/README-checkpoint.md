I referenced our previous activities a lot for help with this assignment. From setting up the API calls to setting up the plots, these previous assignments and activities were immensely helpful.
Xpert AI was also a tool I leaned on for this assignment. It is great for small snags in building out code or for helping guide when feeling lost on how to proceed.
Office Hours: After trying many different tweaks to my code, consulting Xpert AI, and consulting Monica through Office Hours, I could not figure out why my code is resulting in "No Hotel Found" for each city. I've tried adding "/categories=accommodation.hotel" to the base URL, but still no hotels were found. Monica mentioned that other students had a similar issue and it was related to the API key, however, after trying new API keys several times, I still had no luck. Monica suggested I submit my assignment as is because no issues were seen with my code.
Only other resource used was the API documentation for examples and information.
